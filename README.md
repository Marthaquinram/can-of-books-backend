## Overview

The purpose of this repo is to identify books on my bookshelf that I would recommend to be added to anyone's library for their entertainment or educational purposes. This project is comprised of a React front-end connected to a back-end Express server which connects to a Mongo database seeded with data related to some of our favorite books.
